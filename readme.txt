Taquilla enables you to create and manage movies and results in your WP's admin area. No HTML knowledge is needed. A comfortable backend allows to easily edit movie data. You can include the movies into your posts, on your pages or in text widgets by using a shortcode or a template tag function. Results can be imported from Excel format.

The plugin was inspired by TobiasBg "WP-Table Reloaded".

The plugin has been tested with PHP 4.4.7.

== Installation ==

The easiest way would be through your WordPress Admin area. Go to the plugin section and search for "Taquilla" in the WordPress Plugin Directory. Then you can click "Install now" and the following steps will be done for you automatically. You just have to activate the plugin (step 5).

Manual Installation works just as for most other WordPress plugins:

1. Extract the zip file and just drop the folder "Taquilla" into the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.

1. Activate the Plugin "Taquilla" on your "Plugins" page.

1. Create and manage movies via "Taquilla" in the "Tools" section.

1. Include a movie by adding either the shortcode [movie id=&lt;your-movie's-id&gt; /] or [movie]&lt;your-movie's-title&gt;[/movie] to your post, page or text widget.

1. You might want to add styling features via your blog's theme's CSS file (probably style.css) or via the option in the "Plugin Options" screen, where you can enter your CSS directly.
